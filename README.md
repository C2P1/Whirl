</p>   


The homescreen greets the user using their name which they signed up with. The greeting itself is dependent on the time of day. 

The homescreen contains options for the user to add a main focus for the day (by clicking around where the blank underline is), and add items to a todo list (by pressing anywhere on the New Todo line).
